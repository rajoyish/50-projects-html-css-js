          One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
          himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
        </p>

        <p>
          He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he
          could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into
          stiff sections.

          The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off

          A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa
          was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he
          had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice,
          gilded frame.

          It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat
          upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower
          arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at
